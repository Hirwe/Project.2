                Drip & Dry can use various marketing strategies to promote its new offerings that include Mass media adverts through radio and television advertisement, social media advertisement contests, printing fliers and billboard advertisement. 
Social media advertisement through Facebook and Twitter especially can be effective because they are the ones that most of Drip & Dry customers use to get engaged with the business and are generally cheaper, radio and television advertisements are also effective for they deliver the message directly to the customers in a brief and precise way and also the community bulletin boards for they are cheaper and can be visible to most of the customers and they are also durable.  
Since the majority of customers are the most targeted to increase and maintain, who are in the demographic segment of 18-25 and are the local residents, these promotion strategies can easily reach out to them like the community bulletin boards and printed fliers will easily reach out to the majority residents and since most of the social media users are the youth, social media will also easily reach out to the target customers in the demographic segment of 18-25 years, (College for America, 2017).
The marketing strategies to also use could be videos through the internet especially on social media for many social media users especially on Instagram like watching videos and other streaming sites like YouTube with attention to video ads for they not only tell but also show and entertain, (Maloney, 2018). According to Eddie Madan, CEO of Edkent Media, video engagement rates are higher than engagement with other types of media because, as he puts it, who doesn’t love being entertained? Video ads allow users to drop their guard and willingly view a commercial. If the video is animated, the chance that they will view the ad is even higher, (Maloney, 2018). Through using the video strategy on social media, streaming sites and mass media channels will reveal the picture and also tell the story about the new company offering which will spread the message to our target customers who are youth most of who use the internet and social media channels and the few others who rely on mass media channels.
Social media marketing model could be the best digital marketing model with Drip & Dry with specifically its Facebook and Twitter tools because they are able to reach to a large customer base where 500 people already like the company’s Facebook page, therefore, the information can spread easily to the customers. In addition, most customers take advantage of the weekly online coupons for coffee posted on Twitter, therefore, it can be a good platform to inform the same customers about the new company offerings, (College for America, 2017). These show how most customers usually benefit from these digital tools. Digital marketing social media tool will increase digital interactions with customers which will lead to product innovation through gathering insights which can shape the innovation pipeline through helping nurture new sources of revenue which will help increase the value of the company, (Egol, Peterson, & Stroh, 2014). The other strategy could be digital branders marketers that focus on building and renewing brand equity and deeper consumer engagement from traditional linear advertising toward more immersive digital multimedia experiences that can connect consumers to the brand in new ways, (Egol, Peterson, & Stroh, 2014). This is so beneficial to the business for it connects consumers to the brand and if there are any changes, perhaps the new offerings customers may be able to know them and show their view upon them which can be suitable for Drip & Dry.

                Drip & Dry can use various marketing strategies to promote its new offerings that include Mass media adverts through radio and television advertisement, social media advertisement contests, printing fliers and billboard advertisement.

Since the majority of customers are the most targeted to increase and maintain, who are in the demographic segment of 18-25 and are the local residents, these promotion strategies can easily reach out to them like the community bulletin boards and printed fliers will easily reach out to the majority residents and since most of the social media users are the youth, social media will also easily reach out to the target customers in the demographic segment of 18-25 years, (College for America, 2017).
The marketing strategies to also use could be videos through the internet especially on social media for many social media users especially on Instagram like watching videos and other streaming sites like YouTube with attention to video ads for they not only tell but also show and entertain, (Maloney, 2018).

Video ads allow users to drop their guard and willingly view a commercial. If the video is animated, the chance that they will view the ad is even higher, (Maloney, 2018). Through using the video strategy on social media, streaming sites and mass media channels will reveal the picture and also tell the story about the new company offering which will spread the message to our target customers who are youth most of who use the internet and social media channels and the few others who rely on mass media channels.
